This practice is dedicated to enhancing and restoring functionality, mobility, and quality of life for those affected by injuries or diseases of the nervous system. At Lume Health, we use a variety of techniques tailored to each individual's needs, including strength and flexibility exercises, balance and coordination training, manual therapy, and motor relearning strategies. The goal is to help patients achieve the highest possible level of independence and manage symptoms effectively in a way that is both empowering and rehabilitative.",

      intro: "What is Hydrotherapy?",
      description: "Hydrotherapy, also known as aquatic therapy, is a form of physiotherapy that utilizes the properties of water to facilitate healing and exercise. Conducted in a pool with warm water, hydrotherapy leverages the buoyancy, resistance, and hydrostatic pressure of water to support the body, decrease joint stress, and provide resistance which helps in strengthening muscles. The warmth of the water also promotes muscle relaxation and increases blood circulation, which can help alleviate pain and improve range of motion. Commonly used for rehabilitation, pain management, and conditioning, hydrotherapy is suitable for a variety of conditions including arthritis, post-operative recovery, spinal cord injuries, and neurological disorders. It is particularly beneficial for patients who might find traditional land-based exercises too painful or difficult, as the aquatic environment reduces the effects of gravity and helps enhance movement and flexibility.",

The buoyancy of water reduces the load on weight-bearing joints, bones, and muscles, which is especially beneficial for individuals recovering from injuries or surgeries, and those with arthritis or obesity. This buoyant effect allows for easier and pain-reduced movement, enabling patients to perform exercises that might be too painful or difficult on land. The warm water also helps in relaxing muscles and increasing blood flow to injured areas, which accelerates healing and decreases recovery time."

By addressing physical issues early, it prevents them from becoming severe as the child grows. Tailored therapies help children reach developmental milestones like walking and fine motor skills, enhancing their independence. Moreover, these programs support families by teaching them how to assist their child's development at home, fostering an environment where children can thrive physically, emotionally, and socially.

It begins with a thorough assessment with our Physiotherapist to determine the patient's physical capabilities and needs, which guides the customization of a rehabilitation plan. This plan often includes mobility and strength training to regain muscle mass and joint function, pain management techniques such as manual therapy and the use of heat or ice, and functional training in daily activities to ensure a safe return to independence. Additionally, patients receive education on their condition and self-management strategies to facilitate long-term recovery.
